The advent of Next-generation sequencing (NGS) makes it possible to produce DNA
sequence information effectively by dividing individual DNA to massive number
of short fragments and reading these massive sequences concurrently. At the
result of these parallelized processing, high computational resources are
needed to reconstruct the divided fragment sequence as the original order.
mrFAST, one of the DNA sequence matching tools, promise highest
comprehensiveness, however, it is slower than other tools. We propose a new
algorithm, FastHASH, which drastically improves performance over mrFAST, while
maintaining comprehensiveness.\\
