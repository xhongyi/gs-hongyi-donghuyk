\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion} 

In this work, we analyzed hash-table based DNA sequencing tool and proposed an
optimization algorithm called FastHAST. FastHAST provides 38x speedup. We also
implemented FastHASH in GPU. Currently the GPU implementation is not perfectly
tuned but still it is slightly faster than our CPU implementation. In the
future, we will tune GPU implementation and further optimize Adjacency
Filtering algorithm to speed it up.\\
